# Reports Directory Structure

## Assignment 3
The main report and all supporting materials for Assignment 3 are stored in the `Assignment3` directory. The directory contains the following structure:

### supportMaterial
This folder contains all the supporting evidence and visualization materials:

#### Frame
- Contains TF tree diagrams generated by `tf2_tools view_frames`
- These diagrams visualize the coordinate transformations and relationships between different robot components during runtime

#### Image
- Contains screenshots captured during robot simulation
- Includes visual evidence of various robot operations and behaviors
- Documents key moments and results from different test scenarios

#### MappingResult
- Stores occupancy grid maps generated by SLAM
- Contains the final mapping results from the robot's exploration

#### rosgraph
- Contains ROS2 node relationship diagrams generated by `rqt_graph`
- Visualizes the communication structure between different ROS2 nodes
- Helps understand the system's runtime architecture and message flow

The supporting materials provide comprehensive documentation of the robot's performance, system architecture, and operational results during testing and demonstration phases.
