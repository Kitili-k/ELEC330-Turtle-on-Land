# Code Directory Structure

This directory contains all the code-related files for the turtle robot project, organized into three main sections:

## Assignment3Package
- Contains the latest version of the ROS2 package
- Represents the final implementation of all robot functionalities
- Features a complete integration of all components
- Ready for deployment and demonstration

## Attempts
This folder documents our development process through various iterations:
- Early versions of different components:
  - SLAM implementation attempts
  - Navigation system development
  - Visual recognition system iterations
  - Integration experiments
- Serves as a development history
- Contains valuable learning experiences and alternative approaches

## Reference
Collection of example code and demonstrations:
- Online community references
  - Best practice implementations
  - Community solutions
- Official ROS2 demos
  - Navigation examples
  - SLAM tutorials
  - Vision processing demonstrations
- Serves as a learning resource and implementation guide

### Purpose of This Structure
- Maintains clear separation between final code and development attempts
- Preserves valuable learning resources and references
- Documents the development journey from initial attempts to final implementation
- Provides a comprehensive resource for future development or troubleshooting
